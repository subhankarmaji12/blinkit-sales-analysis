## Overview
This project aims to leverage data analysis and machine learning to enhance the sales performance of Blinkit. By analyzing various factors such as item MRP, outlet type, item visibility, and sales data, the goal is to extract actionable insights and build predictive models to optimize sales strategies.

## Project Structure
- *Dataset/*: Contains the dataset(s) used for analysis.
- *blinkit.ipynb*: Includes Python scripts for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and modeling.
- *notebooks/*: Jupyter notebooks for interactive data exploration and visualization.
- *README.md*: Project documentation.

## Key Features
- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand data trends.
- *Feature Engineering*: Creation of meaningful features to improve model performance.
- *Predictive Modeling*:
  - *Linear Regression*: Analyzing the impact of MRP on sales.
  - *RandomForestClassifier*: Identifying underperforming outlets.
  - *RandomForestRegressor*: Evaluating the effect of item visibility on sales.
- *Insights and Recommendations*: Data-driven strategies to improve sales and optimize pricing.
